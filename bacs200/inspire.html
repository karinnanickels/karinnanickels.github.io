        Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an inspiration to women everywhere. As the second woman ever to serve on the United States Supreme Court, she was a trailblazer for gender equality and continuously shattered glass ceilings throughout her career.

        As a femenist and an proud believer in equality, RBG is an inspiration to me because she encouraged women to be independent, fought for women's rights, and fought for women to have bodily autonomy. Some of her many achievements are listed below:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Graduated first in her class from Columbia Law School</li>
        <li>Became the first person on both Harvard and Columbia Law Review</li>
        <li>Co-founded the Women's Rights Project at the American Cilil Liberties Union</li>
        <li>Second woman and first Jewish person to serve on the US Supreme Court</li>
        <li>Fought for the rights of LGBTQ+ community, undocumented people, and disabled people in addition to fighting for women's rights</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>
        Over the course of her lifetime, Ruth Bader Ginsberg showed women everywhere how to believe in themselves. She showed them that they could accomplish anything that they set their mind to. She showed them how much progress can be made when you fight back. Ginsburg is an icon and an inspiration to any member of society who has ever faced discrimination.
